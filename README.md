# LedgerLine â€” Bank Reconciliation

LedgerLine is a Python-based finance service designed to handle bank transaction ingestion, deduplication, and categorization with user-defined rules. It provides statement reconciliation and spend reporting through a clean FastAPI interface. Built with SQLAlchemy, Alembic, and PostgreSQL, LedgerLine demonstrates best practices for building extensible, test-driven backend systems in Python.

## Features list (to be added)
- Transaction import from CSV/OFX formats
- Idempotent deduplication using stable transaction hashes
- Priority-based rule engine for categorization and normalization
- Statement reconciliation with variance reporting
- Spend-by-category reporting endpoints
- FastAPI interface with OpenAPI docs
- Postgres persistence with migrations (Alembic)
- TDD-first architecture with pytest + hypothesis
